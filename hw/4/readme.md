### Details:  
ZeroR classifier implemented. Run TestZeroR to check the output.  
  
Naive Bayes (Nb) classifier has also been implemented. We were not sure how to deal with cases where the probability for both classes was coming out to be 0. So, we decided to select the mode in such cases.   
Run TestNb to check the output.  

The training limit for ZeroR is 2, and for Naive Bayes is 4.  
M is set as 0.001 for SymLike.
