HW 8

Folder Resultant DataSets contain the following :
(a) Two class datasets for each leaf cluster, class1, from RPTree and the cluster it envies the most, class2 (used for local learning).
(b) Two class dataset for rows ranked by its domination. Top 20% have a class-system of best while the remaining 80% have a class-system of rest (global learning)

Folder Resultant Decision Trees contain the following :
(a) Trees.md for the print out of the trees from (a) above. 
(b) resultantGlobalLearningDT.md for the print out of the tree from (b) above. 

The output for the domination predicate test is in rowBestRest.md. To generate similar output, run ```TestDominate.java```  
You should run ```TestRP.java``` to perform Local Learning, and generate the corresponding cluster datasets and decision trees.  
You should run ```TestGlobalLearning.java``` to perform Global Learning for part 7.
