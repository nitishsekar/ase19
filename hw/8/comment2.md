<p>A very important question that the paper presents, 'does learning from too many projects have detrimental effects?', is pertinent to the scope of answering – value of  local vs global learning. From the perspective of complexity, there’s not much difference we found between local & global learners given that the depth of the trees are very similar. Thus, in the context of complexity, learning from too many projects or global learning hasn’t been detrimental, while global learning gives a more general insight.  Hence, we would say that global learning is better in this context.</p>
<p>Neither set of trees are overfit, so size of dataset doesn’t seem to introduce or remove bias. But our trees are very different in the context of attribute selection. The global learner is driven by goal features, while the local ones have no such definite motif. That defeats the purpose of our project vis-a-vis goal optimization.  </p>
