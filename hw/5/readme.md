### Details:  
Assignment on splitting Num & Sym based on SD & Entropy respectively.
The HW document said that the function should be able to receive a list of anything. So, we've written code to receive a list Strings that contain an x,y pair (comma separated). We also send a keyword - Sym or Num - specifying the type of y values present in the list.
